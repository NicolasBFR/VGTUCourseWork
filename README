# Encryptor
This is a small project to encrypt strings with four basics encryption:

- Atbash
- Caesar
- Vigen√®re
- A home-made caesar derivate where the first letter of a word is the caesar offset for the other letters of the word.
## How to use
Just go to the console, choose your encryption, then if you want to encode or decode, then follow encryption instructions.
